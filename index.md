## What is GP 2?

GP 2 is a visual, rule-based graph programming language which frees programmers from handling low-level data structures for graphs. 

A GP 2 program algorithmically transforms an input graph into an output graph by sequentially applying graph transformation systems. GP 2 is computationally complete; it can compute any computable partial function on labelled graphs. There are also a number of results on the verification and correctness of graph programs using [Hoare logic](https://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst/article/view/827) and [Confluence analysis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-74730-9_8) (see *Verification of Graph Programs* in the [publications page](/publications)). 

Our existing compiler generates raw C code from a GP 2 program's source code. This source code, which is concise and optimised, is capable of competing with textbook C programs for some graph problems (see [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-40530-8_7)).

GP 2 programs combine the speed of low-level C programming with the expressiveness of graph transformation. If you want to transform graphs, GP 2 should be your go-to tool.
