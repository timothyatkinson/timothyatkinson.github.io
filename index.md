## What is GP 2?

GP 2 is a visual, rule-based graph programming language which frees programmers from handling low-level data structures for graphs. 
The language's concise formal semantics supports reasoning on GP 2 programs that borrows results from category theory. For example, significant research has 
gone into establishing whether a graph program will terminate and will produce a correct result. 

Below is an example GP 2 program:
